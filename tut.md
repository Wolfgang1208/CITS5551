# Resources
- Each team will have a client. They are the domain experts and the end user of the products.
- Each team will have a mentor (someone from client side). These are the expertes who will advice on the perojects.
- If there is a budget to support projects, and pay for hardware, host fee.

# Tools
- In general you can use whatever software tools you like but client consent is needed. If there is a cost associated, you will need to make a business case and liaise with client.
- However you must use GitHub, and your client and unit facilitator should be added to the repo. Your commits and activity will be noted.
- You must also use MS Teams. Unit coordinator will make dedicated channel for each team. Your mentor is added and your contributions will be noted
- 
- The team member
    - weekly document giving details of every member work during that week at MS Teams
    - any issues should be raised 

# Next Step
- meet team
    - requirement with clients
- Git repo


# Guidelines
- Prepare a Framework
    - Conceptual design
    - Various sub-systems
    - How you can check the functionality of the sub-system individually
- Prepare a Timeline
    - Understand inter-dependent or independent modules
    - You can divide independent modules among the group members
    - Assume that the module will not work 
- Keep the client updated
- Discuss with mentor
- Be proactiv
    - Be mentally prepared
    - Keep extra time

# Team Development Model
- Stages:
    - Forming
        need leadership or something
    - Storming
    - Norming
        should have a manager
    - Performing
    - Adjouring
        Wrapping up and documentation

Storming before meet with client

Meeting agenda

Frequent meeting with client

Shouldn't overcommit and under deliver

Environment specifications(?) <= client

Make should have a WBS work break down

Spend time on doing project

Everyone should meet with client during client meeting\

Members should know what each others are doing

Backup plans

# Mistake:
- Staring the development process before thoroughly clarifying and understanding stakeholders' requirements.

# Lesson: I have now learnt that I cannot think of my ability, but of the team if I am to be successful in industry
